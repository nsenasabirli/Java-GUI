# Java-GUI

Project Description: The purpose of the Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) is to enable Java programs to interact visually and provide users with an interface that allows them to perform actions easily. Its primary goal is to offer a user-friendly experience by allowing users to interact with the program graphically through input devices such as a mouse and keyboard, rather than using a text-based console interface.

## Features

- Feature 1: User-Friendly Interface: It provides a visually appealing and organized interface to help users understand and use the program more easily.
- Feature 2: Interactivity: Users can directly interact with the program by inputting data, clicking buttons, selecting options, and initiating processes.
- Feature 3: Prompt Feedback: It offers quick feedback to users about the actions they perform; for instance, providing visual feedback when a button is clicked to indicate that a process is initiated.
- Feature 4: Visual Representations: It can visually represent data to aid better understanding. Visual elements such as graphs, tables, and drawings can be used for data presentation.
- Feature 5: Ease of Use: Compared to text-based interfaces, it provides a more intuitive and comprehensible experience, making the program easier to use.
